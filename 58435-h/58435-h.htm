<p class="poem">
  So I have known this life,<br />
  These beads of coloured days,<br />
  This self the string.<br />
  What is this thing?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Not beauty, no; not greed,<br />
  O, not indeed;<br />
  Not all, though much;<br />
  Its colour is not such.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It has no eyes to see,<br />
  It has no ears;<br />
  It is a red hour's war<br />
  Followed by tears.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It is an hour of time,<br />
  An hour of road,<br />
  Flesh is its goad;<br />
  Yet, in the sorrowing lands,<br />
  Women and men take hands.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O earth, give us the corn,<br />
  Come rain, come sun;<br />
  We men who have been born<br />
  Have tasks undone.<br />
  Out of this earth<br />
  Comes the thing birth,<br />
  The thing unguessed, unwon.<br />
</p>

  II.<br />

<p class="poem">
  O wretched man, that for a little mile<br />
  Crawls beneath heaven for his brother's blood,<br />
  Whose days the planets number with their style,<br />
  To whom all earth is slave, all living, food!<br />
  O withering man, within whose folded shell<br />
  Lies yet the seed, the spirit's quickening corn,<br />
  That Time and Sun will change out of the cell<br />
  Into green meadows, in the world unborn!<br />
  If Beauty be a dream, do but resolve<br />
  And fire shall come, that in the stubborn clay<br />
  Works to make perfect till the rocks dissolve,<br />
  The barriers burst, and Beauty takes her way:<br />
  Beauty herself, within whose blossoming Spring<br />
  Even wretched man shall clap his hands and sing.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

  III.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Out of the special cell's most special sense<br />
  Came the suggestion when the light was sweet;<br />
  All skill, all beauty, all magnificence,<br />
  Are hints so caught, man's glimpse of the complete.<br />
  And, though the body rots, that sense survives;<br />
  Being of life's own essence, it endures<br />
  (Fruit of the spirit's tillage in men's lives)<br />
  Round all this ghost that wandering flesh immures.<br />
  That is our friend, who, when the iron brain<br />
  Assails, or the earth clogs, or the sun hides,<br />
  Is the good God to whom none calls in vain,<br />
  Man's Achieved Good, which, being Life, abides:<br />
  The man-made God, that man in happy breath<br />
  Makes in despite of Time and dusty Death.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
  IV.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  You are the link which binds us each to each.<br />
  Passion, or too much thought, alone can end<br />
  Beauty, the ghost, the spirit's common speech,<br />
  Which man's red longing left us for our friend.<br />
  Even in the blinding war I have known this,<br />
  That flesh is but the carrier of a ghost<br />
  Who, through his longing, touches that which is<br />
  Even as the sailor knows the foreign coast.<br />
  So by the bedside of the dying black<br />
  I felt our uncouth souls subtly made one:<br />
  Forgiven, the meanness of each other's lack;<br />
  Forgiven, the petty tale of ill things done.<br />
  We were but Man, who for a tale of days<br />
  Seeks the one city by a million ways.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
  V.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I could not sleep for thinking of the sky,<br />
  The unending sky, with all its million suns<br />
  Which turn their planets everlastingly<br />
  In nothing, where the fire-haired comet runs.<br />
  If I could sail that nothing, I should cross<br />
  Silence and emptiness with dark stars passing;<br />
  Then, in the darkness, see a point of gloss<br />
  Burn to a glow, and glare, and keep amassing,<br />
  And rage into a sun with wandering planets,<br />
  And drop behind; and then, as I proceed,<br />
  See his last light upon his last moon's granites<br />
  Die to a dark that would be night indeed:<br />
  Night where my soul might sail a million years<br />
  In nothing, not even Death, not even tears.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
  VI.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  How did the nothing come, how did these fires,<br />
  These million-leagues of fires, first toss their hair,<br />
  Licking the moons from heaven in their ires,<br />
  Flinging them forth for them to wander there?<br />
  What was the Mind?  Was it a mind which thought?<br />
  Or chance? or law? or conscious law? or power?<br />
  Or a vast balance by vast clashes wrought?<br />
  Or Time at trial with Matter for an hour?<br />
  Or is it all a body where the cells<br />
  Are living things supporting something strange,<br />
  Whose mighty heart the singing planet swells<br />
  As it shoulders nothing in unending change?<br />
  Is this green earth of many-peopled pain<br />
  Part of a life, a cell within a brain?<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
  VII.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  It may be so; but let the unknown be.<br />
  We, on this earth, are servants of the sun:<br />
  Out of the sun comes all the quick in me,<br />
  His golden touch is life to everyone.<br />
  His power it is that makes us spin through space;<br />
  His youth is April and his manhood bread;<br />
  Beauty is but a looking on his face;<br />
  He clears the mind, he makes the roses red.<br />
  What he may be, who knows?  But we are his;<br />
  We roll through nothing round him, year by year,<br />
  The withering leaves upon a tree which is,<br />
  Each with his greed, his little power, his fear,<br />
  What we may be, who knows?  But every one<br />
  Is dust on dust a servant of the sun.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
  VIII.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The Kings go by with jewelled crowns;<br />
  Their horses gleam, their banners shake, their spears are many.<br />
  The sack of many-peopled towns<br />
  Is all their dream;<br />
  The way they take<br />
  Leaves but a ruin in the brake,<br />
  And, in the furrow that the ploughmen make,<br />
  A stampless penny: a tale, a dream.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The merchants reckon up their gold;<br />
  Their letters come, their ships arrive, their freights are glories;<br />
  The profits of their treasures sold<br />
  They tell and sum;<br />
  Their foremen drive<br />
  The servants starved to half-alive,<br />
  Whose labours do but make the earth a hive<br />
  Of stinking stories: a tale, a dream.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The priests are singing in their stalls;<br />
  Their singing lifts, their incense burns, their praying clamours;<br />
  Yet God is as the sparrow falls;<br />
  The ivy drifts,<br />
  The votive urns<br />
  Are all left void when Fortune turns;<br />
  The god is but a marble for the kerns<br />
  To break with hammers: a tale, a dream.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O Beauty, let me know again<br />
  The green earth cold, the April rain, the quiet waters figuring sky,<br />
  The one star risen.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So shall I pass into the feast<br />
  Not touched by King, merchant, or priest;<br />
  Know the red spirit of the beast,<br />
  Be the green grain;<br />
  Escape from prison.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
  IX.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  What is this life which uses living cells<br />
  It knows not how nor why, for no known end,<br />
  This soul of man upon whose fragile shells<br />
  Of blood and brain his very powers depend?<br />
  Pour out its little blood or touch its brain,<br />
  The thing is helpless, gone, no longer known;<br />
  The carrion cells are never man again,<br />
  No hand relights the little candle blown.<br />
  It comes not from Without, but from the sperm<br />
  Fed in the womb; it is a man-made thing<br />
  That takes from man its power to live a term,<br />
  Served by live cells of which it is the King.<br />
  Can it be blood and brain?  It is most great.<br />
  Through blood and brain alone it wrestles Fate.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap012"></a></p>

<h3>
  X.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Can it be blood and brain, this transient force<br />
  Which, by an impulse, seizes flesh and grows<br />
  To man, the thing less splendid than the horse,<br />
  More blind than owls, less lovely than the rose?<br />
  O, by a power unknown it works the cells<br />
  Of blood and brain; it has the power to see<br />
  Beyond the apparent thing the something else<br />
  Which it inspires dust to bring to be.<br />
  Both blood and brain are its imperfect tools,<br />
  Easily wrecked, soon worn, slow to attain;<br />
  Only by years of toil the master rules<br />
  To lovely ends those servants, blood and brain.<br />
  And Death, a touch, a germ, has still the force<br />
  To make him ev'n as the rose, the owl, the horse.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
  XI.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Not only blood and brain its servants are;<br />
  There is a finer power that needs no slaves,<br />
  Whose lovely service distance cannot bar,<br />
  Nor the green sea with all her hell of waves;<br />
  Nor snowy mountains, nor the desert sand,<br />
  Nor heat, nor storm, it bends to no control;<br />
  It is a stretching of the spirit's hand<br />
  To touch the brother's or the sister's soul;<br />
  So that from darkness in the narrow room<br />
  I can step forth and be about her heart,<br />
  Needing no star, no lantern in the gloom,<br />
  No word from her, no pointing on the chart,<br />
  Only red knowledge of a window flung<br />
  Wide to the night, and calling without tongue.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
  XII.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Drop me the seed, that I even in my brain<br />
  May be its nourishing earth.  No mortal knows<br />
  From what immortal granary comes the grain,<br />
  Nor how the earth conspires to make the rose;<br />
  But from the dust and from the wetted mud<br />
  Comes help, given or taken; so with me,<br />
  Deep in my brain the essence of my blood<br />
  Shall give it stature until Beauty be.<br />
  It will look down, even as the burning flower<br />
  Smiles upon June, long after I am gone.<br />
  Dust-footed Time will never tell its hour,<br />
  Through dusty Time its rose will draw men on,<br />
  Through dusty Time its beauty will make plain<br />
  Man, and, Without, a spirit-scattering grain.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
  XIII.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Ah, but Without there is no spirit scattering;<br />
  Nothing but Life, most fertile but unwise,<br />
  Passing through change in the sun's heat and cloud's watering,<br />
  Pregnant with self, unlit by inner eyes.<br />
  There is no sower, nor seed for any tillage;<br />
  Nothing but the grey brain's pash, and the tense will,<br />
  And that poor fool of the Being's little village<br />
  Feeling for the truth in the little veins that thrill.<br />
  There is no Sowing, but digging, year by year,<br />
  In a hill's heart, now one way, now another,<br />
  Till the rock breaks and the valley is made clear,<br />
  And the poor Fool stands, and knows the sun for his brother,<br />
  And the Soul shakes wings like a bird escaped from cage,<br />
  And the tribe moves on to camp in its heritage.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
  XIV.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  You are too beautiful for mortal eyes,<br />
  You the divine unapprehended soul;<br />
  The red worm in the marrow of the wise<br />
  Stirs as you pass, but never sees you whole.<br />
  Even as the watcher in the midnight tower<br />
  Knows from a change in heaven an unseen star,<br />
  So from your beauty, so from the summer flower,<br />
  So from the light, one guesses what you are.<br />
  So in the darkness does the traveller come<br />
  To some lit chink, through which he cannot see,<br />
  More than a light, nor hear, more than a hum,<br />
  Of the great hall where Kings in council be.<br />
  So, in the grave, the red and mouthless worm<br />
  Knows of the soul that held his body firm.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
  XV.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Is it a sea on which the souls embark<br />
  Out of the body, as men put to sea?<br />
  Or do we come like candles in the dark<br />
  In the rooms in cities in eternity?<br />
  Is it a darkness that our powers can light?<br />
  Is this, our little lantern of man's love,<br />
  A help to find friends wandering in the night<br />
  In the unknown country with no star above?<br />
  Or is it sleep, unknowing, outlasting clocks<br />
  That outlast men, that, though the cockcrow ring,<br />
  Is but one peace, of the substance of the rocks;<br />
  Is but one space in the now unquickened thing;<br />
  Is but one joy, that, though the million tire,<br />
  Is one, always the same, one life, one fire?<br />

<p class="poem">
  Before Man's labouring wisdom gave me birth<br />
  I had not even seen the light of day;<br />
  Down in the central darkness of the earth,<br />
  Crushed by the weight of continents I lay,<br />
  Ground by the weight to heat, not knowing then<br />
  The air, the light, the noise, the world of men.<br />

  THE TREES.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We grew on mountains where the glaciers cry,<br />

  We knew no men; our life was to stand stanch,<br />
  Singing our song, against the avalanche.<br />

<p class="poem">
  We were a million grasses on the hill,<br />
  A million herbs which bowed as the wind blew,<br />
  Trembling in every fibre, never still;<br />
  Out of the summer earth sweet life we drew.<br />
  Little blue-flowered grasses up the glen,<br />
  Glad of the sun, what did we know of men?<br />

  THE WORKERS.<br />

<p class="poem">
  We tore the iron from the mountain's hold,<br />
  By blasting fires we smithied it to steel;<br />
  Out of the shapeless stone we learned to mould<br />
  The sweeping bow, the rectilinear keel;<br />
  We hewed the pine to plank, we split the fir,<br />
  We pulled the myriad flax to fashion her.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Out of a million lives our knowledge came,<br />
  A million subtle craftsmen forged the means;<br />
  Steam was our handmaid, and our servant flame,<br />
  Water our strength, all bowed to our machines.<br />
  Out of the rock, the tree, the springing herb,<br />
  We built this wandering beauty so superb.<br />

<p class="poem">
  We, who were born on earth and live by air,<br />
  Make this thing pass across the fatal floor,<br />
  The speechless sea; alone we commune there,<br />
  Jesting with Death, that ever-open door.<br />
  Sun, moon, and stars are signs by which we drive<br />
  This wind-blown iron like a thing alive.<br />

  THE BLACKSMITH<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The blacksmith in his sparky forge<br />
  Beat on the white-hot softness there;<br />
  Ever as he beat he sang an air<br />
  To keep the sparks out of his gorge.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So many shoes the blacksmith beat,<br />
  So many shares and links for traces,<br />
  So many builders' struts and braces,<br />
  Such tackling for the chain-fore-sheet,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  That, in his pride, big words he spake:<br />
  "I am the master of my trade;<br />
  What iron is good for I have made,<br />
  I make what is in iron to make."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Daily he sang thus by his fire,<br />
  Till one day, as he poised his stroke<br />
  Above his bar, the iron spoke;<br />
  "You boaster, drop your hammer, liar!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The hammer dropped out of his hand,<br />
  The iron rose, it gathered shape,<br />
  It took the blacksmith by the nape,<br />
  It pressed him to the furnace, and<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Heaped fire upon him till his form<br />
  Was molten, flinging sparks aloft,<br />
  Until his bones were melted soft,<br />
  His hairs crisped in a fiery storm.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The iron drew him from the blaze<br />
  To place him on the anvil; then<br />
  It beat him from the shape of men,<br />
  Like drugs the apothecary brays;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Beat him to ploughing coulters, beat<br />
  Body and blood to links of chain,<br />
  With endless hammerings of pain<br />
  Unending torment of white heat;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And did not stop the work, but still<br />
  Beat on him while the furnace roared.<br />
  The blacksmith suffered and implored,<br />
  With iron bonds upon his will.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And, though he could not die nor shrink,<br />
  He felt his being beat by force<br />
  To horseshoes stamped on by the horse,<br />
  And into troughs whence cattle drink.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He felt his blood, his dear delight,<br />
  Beat into shares, he felt it rive<br />
  The green earth red; he was alive,<br />
  Dragged through the earth by horses' might.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He felt his brain, that once had planned<br />
  His daily life, changed to a chain<br />
  Which curbed a sail or dragged a wain,<br />
  Or hoisted shiploads to the land.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He felt his heart, that once had thrilled<br />
  With love of wife and little ones,<br />
  Cut out and mingled with his bones<br />
  To pin the bricks where men rebuild.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He felt his very self impelled<br />
  To common uses, till he cried:<br />
  "There's more within me than is tried,<br />
  More than you ever think to weld.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "For all my pain I am only used<br />
  To make the props for daily labour;<br />
  I burn, I am beaten like a tabour<br />
  To make men tools: I am abused.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Deep in the white heat where I gasp<br />
  I see the unmastered finer powers.<br />
  Iron by cunning wrought to flowers,<br />
  File-worked, not tortured by the rasp.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Deep in this fire-tortured mind<br />
  Thought bends the bar in subtler ways;<br />
  It glows into the mass, its rays<br />
  Purge, till the iron is refined.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Then, as the full moon draws the tide<br />
  Out of the vague uncaptained sea.<br />
  Some moony-power there ought to be<br />
  To work on ore; it should be tried.<br />
</p>

  "By this fierce fire in which I ache<br />

  COTTA.  LUCIUS.  THEIR CHIEF.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  COTTA. Would God the route would come for home!<br />
  My God! this place, day after day,<br />
  A month of heavy march from Rome!<br />
  This camp, the troopers' huts of clay,<br />
  The horses tugging at their pins,<br />
  The roaring brook and then the whins,<br />
  And nothing new to do or say!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  LUCIUS. They say the tribes are up.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  COTTA.                              Who knows!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  LUCIUS. Our scouts say that they saw their fires.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  COTTA. Well, if we fight it's only blows<br />
  And bogging horses in the mires.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  LUCIUS. Their raiders crossed the line last night,<br />
  Eastward from this, to raid the stud;<br />
  They stole our old chief's stallion, Kite.<br />
  He's in pursuit.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  COTTA. That looks like blood.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  LUCIUS. Well, better that than dicing here<br />
  Beside this everlasting stream.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  COTTA. My God! I was in Rome last year,<br />
  Under the sun; it seems a dream.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  LUCIUS. Things are not going well in Rome;<br />
  This frontier war is wasting men<br />
  Like water, and the Tartars come<br />
  In hordes.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  COTTA. We beat them back agen.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  LUCIUS. So far we have, and yet I feel<br />
  The empire is too wide a bow<br />
  For one land's strength.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  COTTA.                    The stuff's good steel.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  LUCIUS. Too great a strain may snap it, though.<br />
  If we were ordered home...<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  COTTA. Good Lord! ...<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  LUCIUS. If ... then our friends, the tribesmen there,<br />
  Would have glad days.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  COTTA.                This town would flare<br />
  To warm old Foxfoot and his horde.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  LUCIUS. We have not been forethoughtful here,<br />
  Pressing the men to fill the ranks;<br />
  Centurions sweep the province clear.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  COTTA. Rightly.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  LUCIUS.           Perhaps.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  COTTA.                        We get no thanks.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  LUCIUS. We strip the men for troops abroad,<br />
  And leave the women and the slaves<br />
  For merchants and their kind. The graves<br />
  Of half each province line the road;<br />
  These people could not stand a day<br />
  Against the tribes, with us away.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  COTTA. Rightly.<br />
</p>

  LUCIUS.           Perhaps.<br />

  COTTA.                      Here comes the Chief.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  LUCIUS. Sir, did your riders catch the thief?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  CHIEF. No; he got clear and keeps the horse.<br />
  But bad news always comes with worse:<br />
  The frontier's fallen, we're recalled,<br />
  Our army's broken, Rome's appalled!<br />
  My God! the whole world's in a blaze.<br />
  So now we've done with idle days,<br />
  Fooling on frontiers.  Boot and start.<br />
  It gives a strange feel in the heart<br />
  To think that this, that Rome has made,<br />
  Is done with.  Yes, the stock's decayed.<br />
  We march at once.  You mark my words:<br />
  We're done, we're crumbled into sherds;<br />
  We shall not see this place again<br />
  When once we go.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  LUCIUS.           Do none remain?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  CHIEF. No, none; all march.  Here ends the play.<br />
  March, and burn camp.  The order's gone;<br />
  Your men have sent your baggage on.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  COTTA. My God! hark how the trumpets bray!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  CHIEF. They do.  You see the end of things.<br />
  The power of a thousand kings<br />
  Helped us to this, and now the power<br />
  Is so much hay that was a flower.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  LUCIUS. We have been very great and strong.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  CHIEF. That's over now.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  LUCIUS.                   It will be long<br />
  Before the world will see our like.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  CHIEF. We've kept these thieves beyond the dyke<br />
  A good long time, here on the Wall.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  LUCIUS. Colonel, we ought to sound a call<br />
  To mark the end of this.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  CHIEF.                    We ought.<br />
  Look, there's the hill-top where we fought<br />
  Old Foxfoot.  Look, there in the whin.<br />
  Old ruffian knave!  Come on!  Fall in!<br />

  The fox came up by Stringer's Pound;<br />
  He smelt the south-west warm on the ground,<br />
  From west to east a feathery smell<br />
  Of blood on the wing-quills tasting well.<br />
  A buck's hind-feet thumped on the sod,<br />
  The whip-like grass snake went to clod,<br />
  The dog-fox put his nose in the air<br />
  To taste what food was wandering there.<br />
  Under the clover down the hill<br />
  A hare in form that knew his will.<br />
  Up the hill the warren awake<br />
  And the badger showing teeth like a rake.<br />
  Down the hill the two twin thorpes<br />
  Where the crying night owl waked the corpse,<br />
  And the moon on the stilly windows bright<br />
  Instead of a dead man's waking light.<br />
  The cock on his perch that shook his wing<br />
  When the clock struck for the chimes to ring,<br />
  A duck that muttered, a rat that ran,<br />
  And a horse that stamped, remembering man.<br />

  The cats upon the pointed housetops peered<br />
  About the chimneys, with lit eyes which saw<br />
  Things in the darkness, moving, which they feared;<br />
  The midnight filled the quiet house with awe.<br />
  So, creeping down the stair, I drew the bolt<br />
  And passed into the darkness, and I knew<br />
  That beauty was brought near by my revolt.<br />
  Beauty was in the moonlight, in the dew,<br />

  Till suddenly the apparitions come<br />
  Above the surface, looking at the skies?<br />
  Or does sweet Beauty dwell in lovely things<br />
  Scattering the holy hintings of her name<br />
  In women, in dear friends, in flowers, in springs,<br />
  In the brook's voice, for us to catch the same?<br />

  Death lies in wait for you, you wild thing in the wood,<br />
  Shy-footed beauty dear, half-seen, half-understood.<br />
  Glimpsed in the beech-wood dim and in the dropping fir,<br />
  Shy like a fawn and sweet and beauty's minister.<br />
  Glimpsed as in flying clouds by night the little moon,<br />
  A wonder, a delight, a paleness passing soon.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Only a moment held, only an hour seen,<br />
  Only an instant known in all that life has been,<br />
  One instant in the sand to drink that gush of grace,<br />
  The beauty of your way, the marvel of your face.<br />
  Death lies in wait for you, but few short hours he gives;<br />
  I perish even as you by whom all spirit lives.<br />
  Come to me, spirit, come, and fill my hour of breath<br />
  With hours of life in life that pay no toll to death.<br />
</p>

  They called that broken hedge The Haunted Gate.<br />
  Strange fires (they said) burnt there at moonless times.<br />
  Evil was there, men never went there late,<br />
  The darkness there was quick with threatened crimes.<br />
  And then one digging in that bloodied clay<br />
  Found, but a foot below, a rotted chest.<br />
  Coins of the Romans, tray on rusted tray,<br />
  Hurriedly heaped there by a digger prest.<br />
  So that one knew how, centuries before,<br />
  Some Roman flying from the sack by night,<br />
  Digging in terror there to hide his store,<br />
  Sweating his pick, by windy lantern light,<br />
  Had stamped his anguish on that place's soul,<br />
  So that it knew and could rehearse the whole.<br />

<p class="poem">
  There was an evil in the nodding wood<br />
  Above the quarry long since overgrown,<br />
  Something which stamped it as a place of blood<br />
  Where tortured spirit cried from murdered bone.<br />
  Then, after years, I saw a rusty knife<br />
  Stuck in a woman's skull, just as 'twas found,<br />
  Blackt with a centuried crust of clotted life,<br />
  In the red clay of that unholy ground.<br />
  So that I knew the unhappy thing had spoken,<br />
  That tongueless thing for whom the quarry spoke,<br />
  The evil seals of murder had been broken<br />
  By the red earth, the grass, the rooted oak,<br />
  The inarticulate dead had forced the spade,<br />
  The hand, the mind, till murder was displayed.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Go, spend your penny, Beauty, when you will,<br />
  In the grave's darkness let the stamp be lost.<br />
  The water still will bubble from the hill,<br />
  And April quick the meadows with her ghost;<br />
  Over the grass the daffodils will shiver,<br />
  The primroses with their pale beauty abound,<br />
  The blackbird be a lover and make quiver<br />
  With his glad singing the great soul of the ground;<br />
  So that if the body rot, it will not matter;<br />
  Up in the earth the great game will go on,<br />
  The coming of spring and the running of the water,<br />
  And the young things glad of the womb's darkness gone.<br />
  And the joy we felt will be a part of the glory<br />
  In the lover's kiss that makes the old couple's story.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Though in life's streets the tempting shops have lured<br />
  Because all beauty, howsoever base,<br />
  Is vision of you, marred, I have endured,<br />
  Tempted or fall'n, to look upon your face.<br />
  Now through the grinning death's-head in the paint,<br />
  Within the tavern-song, hid in the wine,<br />
  In many-kinded man, emperor and saint,<br />
  I see you pass, you breath of the divine.<br />
  I see you pass, as centuries ago<br />
  The long dead men with passionate spirit saw.<br />
  O brother man, whom spirit habits so,<br />
  Through your red sorrows Beauty keeps her law,<br />
  Beauty herself, who takes your dying hand,<br />
  To leave through Time the Memnon in the sand.<br />

<p class="poem">
  When all these million cells that are my slaves<br />
  Fall from my pourried ribs and leave me lone,<br />
  A living speck among a world of graves,<br />
  What shall I be, that spot in the unknown?<br />
  A glow-worm in a night that floats the sun?<br />
  Or deathless dust feeling the passer's foot?<br />
  An eye undying mourning things undone?<br />
  Or seed for quickening free from prisoning fruit?<br />
  Or an eternal jewel on your robe,<br />
  Caught to your heart, one with the April tire<br />
  That made me yours as man upon the globe,<br />
  One with the spring, a breath in all desire,<br />
  One with the primrose, present in all joy?<br />
  Or pash that rots, which pismires can destroy?<br />

<p class="poem">
  Let that which is to come be as it may,<br />
  Darkness, extinction, justice, life intense,<br />
  The flies are happy in the summer day,<br />
  Flies will be happy many summers hence.<br />
  Time with his antique breeds that built the Sphinx,<br />
  Time with her men to come whose wings will tower,<br />
  Poured and will pour, not as the wise man thinks,<br />
  But with blind force, to each his little hour.<br />
  And when the hour has struck, comes death or change,<br />
  Which, whether good or ill we cannot tell,<br />
  But the blind planet will wander through her range<br />
  Bearing men like us who will serve as well.<br />
  The sun will rise, the winds that ever move<br />
  Will blow our dust that once were men in love.<br />
